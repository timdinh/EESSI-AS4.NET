It is based on https://github.com/bcgit/bc-csharp/tree/master version 1.8.0-RC.1
forked to https://github.com/bartland/bc-csharp/tree/master

Source code difference:
* asn1/pkcs/PBKDF2Params.cs is modified to support sha256, etc.

(Note that, to minimise differences, high level support via security/PbeUtilities.cs is not provided).

Binary:
* built with VS 2008
* BouncyCastle.PbeS2.Crypto, Version=1.8.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=6c46cd4a525665dd
* Assembly FileVersion: 1.8.0.3

This fork will remain until BC csharp fully supports PKCS5v2 as per the Java version.

The changes are compatible with BouncyCastle Java version 1.51 and openssl 1.0.1j.
